## Overview

The TARDIS Train Dashboard is a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing train delay data. It allows users to process, clean, and analyze data related to train schedules and delays. With this tool, users can gain insights into the causes of delays and utilize predictive modeling to forecast future delays.

You can download the latest version of TARDIS from the [Releases section](https://github.com/jorgealarcon88/TARDIS/releases). 

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Clean and prepare train delay data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generate interactive charts and graphs to understand delays better.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use historical data to predict future delays.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate dashboard built with Streamlit.
- **Custom Reports**: Generate reports based on specific criteria.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for data analysis and processing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Streamlit**: To create the interactive dashboard.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
